            <h4>Letra:</h4>
            <p>I remember when<br>
                I remember, I remember when I lost my mind<br>
                There was something so pleasant about that place<br>
                Even your emotions had an echo<br>
                In so much space</p>
            <p>And when you're out there, without care<br>
                Yeah, I was out of touch<br>
                But it wasn't because I didn't know enough<br>
                I just knew too much</p>
            <p>And when you're out there, without care<br>
                Yeah, I was out of touch<br>
                But it wasn't because I didn't know enough<br>
                I just knew too much</p>
            <p>And when you're out there, without care<br>
                Yeah, I was out of touch<br>
                But it wasn't because I didn't know enough<br>
                I just knew too much</p>
            <p>Well, I think you're crazy<br>
                I think you're crazy<br>
                I think you're crazy<br>
                Just like me</p>
            <p>My heroes had the heart<br>
                To lose their lives out on the limb<br>
                And all I remember is thinking: I wanna be like them<br>
                Ever since I was little<br>
                Ever since I was little, it looked like fun<br>
                And it's no coincidence, I've come<br>
                And I can die when I'm done</p>
            <p>But maybe I'm crazy<br>
                Maybe you're crazy<br>
                Maybe we're crazy<br>
                Probably</p>

            <h4>Letra:</h4>
            <p>She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang<br>
                (Get out the way, yo)</p>
            <p>There she goes again, the girl is Ethiopian<br>
                In other words, she came through explodin'<br>
                In the podium, dynamite<br>
                Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum<br>
                Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me</p>
            <p>Cut the convo short 'cause she had to wake up early<br>
                But continuing the story<br>
                Don't worry she gave me digits for her Blackberry<br>
                "You're very handsome" is what she said<br>
                And the way she looked in my eyes said, "Put me to bed"</p>
            <p>Oh my, oh my, I should have known<br>
                When she said to me on the phone<br>
                You do not know me very well but I would never hurt a fly<br>
                Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye<br>
                I said, she aimed for my chest with love in her eye</p>
            <p>Oh my, oh my, I should have known<br>
                When she said to me on the phone<br>
                You do not know me very well but I would never hurt a fly<br>
                Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye<br>
                I said, she aimed for my chest with love in her eye</p>
            <p>She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang</p>
            <p>Scorpion, she's so hot, she's a scorchin'<br>
                Killing me softly, Lauryn or Kevorkian<br>
                Couldn't tell if she's coo-coo or corky, when<br>
                I asked her her name and she said, "Call me Ten"</p>
            <p>Testing, testing, things just got more interesting<br>
                She's dressed in a vest pin, double-breasted holster<br>
                A very western toaster, she ain't nothing Kosher<br>
                She lets me closer, hotter than a pepper crusted samosa<br>
                While I try to keep my composure</p>
            <p>She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun<br>
                Ready to fire me a hot one, it went bang, bang, bang<br>
                Straight through my heart<br>
                Although I could have walked away<br>
                I stood my ground and let her spray</p>
            <p>She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang</p>
            <p>Am I wrong? But what is love without the pain to go along?<br>
                And what is pain, if not the reason for me to sing this song?<br>
                And this song is for the weak and for the strong<br>
                'Cause I was strong and still</p>
            <p>She got me, she got me, bang, bang, she got me<br>
                She got me, she got me, bang, bang</p>
            <p>She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun<br>
                Ready to fire me a hot one, it went bang, bang, bang<br>
                Straight through my heart<br>
                Although I could have walked away<br>
                I stood my ground and let her spray</p>
            <p>She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me<br>
                She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang</p>

            <p>Oh, put your lovin' hand out, baby<br>
                I'm beggin'</p>
            <p>I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
                So put your loving hand out, baby<br>
                I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
                So put your loving hand out, darlin'</p>
            <p>Riding high when I was king<br>
                I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything<br>
                I walked away, but you warned me then<br>
                But easy come and easy go<br>
                And it would end</p>
            <p>So, anytime I bleed, you let me go<br>
                Yeah, anytime I feed, you get me know<br>
                Anytime I seek, you let me know<br>
                But I planted that seed, just let me go</p>
            <p>I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'<br>
                'Cause I don't wanna lose you<br>
                Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta</p>
            <p>'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah<br>
                Uh, put your loving hand out, baby<br>
                I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
                And put your loving hand out, darlin'</p>
            <p>I need you to understand<br>
                Tried so hard to be your man<br>
                The kind of man you want in the end<br>
                Only then can I begin to live again</p>
            <p>An empty shell<br>
                I used to be<br>
                The shadow of my life was hangin' over me<br>
                A broken man<br>
                That I don't know<br>
                Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul</p>
            <p>What we doin'? What we chasin'?<br>
                Why the bottom? Why the basement?<br>
                Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?<br>
                Why the feel for the need to replace me?</p>
            <p>You're the wrong way track from the good<br>
                I want to paint in the picture tellin' where we could be at<br>
                Like a heart in the best way should<br>
                You can give it away, you had it<br>
                And you took the pay</p>
            <p>But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors<br>
                Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours<br>
                Keep also home, 'cause I don't wanna live in a broken home<br>
                Girl, I'm beggin'</p>
            <p>Yeah<br>
                I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
                So put your loving hand out, baby<br>
                I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
                So put your loving hand out, darlin'</p>
            <p>I'm fightin' hard to hold my own<br>
                Just can't make it all alone<br>
                I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back<br>
                I'm just a con 'bout to fade to black</p>
            <p>I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
                Put your loving hand out, baby<br>
                I'm beggin', beggin' you<br>
                So put your loving hand out, darlin'</p>
